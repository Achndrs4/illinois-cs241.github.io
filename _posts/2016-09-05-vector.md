# Groundwork For Text Editor and Shell

You are an intern for Macrohard and your team has decided to have you write a text editor and shell (more details for each when the time comes), which everyone on the team will use. These projects will take you several weeks and your mentor has decided on the following timetable:

*   Week A: Implement a Vector and Document/Log
*   Week B: Implement a Text Editor
*   Week C: Implement a Shell

The Text Editor will be a 1 line text editor that will accept commands from stdin. Your mentor has decided to abstract away documents for this text editor.

The Shell is a terminal. Like all good terminals; your shell will need to remember what commands its user has given it. Your mentor has decided to abstract all of this away as a log.

Now your mentor has realized that a log and document are not that different in the sense they are both just an array of strings. So to implement the log and document your mentor has decided that you will create a "vector" to store strings.

However, after hearing tales of your talent, and with vectors being all the rage, some other team leads have asked you for vectors that they can use in their own projects. One option would be to write a vector for each team. However, being a good programmer, you know that code duplication is bad. Also, you're a lazy programmer, which means you want to write minimal code that can accomplish everything. You decide to implement a 'generic' vector, something that every team can use with minimal changes.

## Vector

A vector is an array that grows and shrinks as a user adds and removes items from it (since CS225 was a prerequisite, you probably knew all of that already). However, your vector will need to be rich with enough features so one can easily create a log or document from it (and other sneaky teams can plug it into their own projects). Your implementation of a vector should go in <tt>vector.c</tt>, which is the only file that will be sent to your team lead for review. As an intern looking to become a fulltime employee, you should create testcases in <tt>vector_test.c</tt> to show that you are a responsible programmer. Your mentor has left notes in <tt>vector.h</tt> on how you should implement this vector.

In case a fellow employee asks you what you learned in CS225, here you go -

* **https://web.archive.org/web/20160119032015/https://chara.cs.illinois.edu/cs225/lectures/slides/lec0928-resizing.pdf**

Since this vector is generic, when adding or removing items, instead of using a single function for all possible types (what could go wrong with this?) you decide to use function pointers, which allow you to create a vector that uses your own 'constructor' and 'destructor' functions. Thus, your vector structure will contain pointers to your constructor or destructor routines, and you can initialize the vector by passing pointers to these functions as parameters.

Here's a skillfully drawn illustration, if it helps -

What you'll end up with is a pretty useful general purpose vector, capable of dynamically expanding and shrinking (No more fixed sized buffers, guys!)


## Document and Log

Your document and log are really similar, so your mentor has negotiated with the team lead for you to only implement one of them. The mentor has chosen for you to implement the document. Both the document and log will use your vector to do all the heavy lifting. Your mentor has provided all the trivial functions for you that assume a correctly implemented vector. The only file that will be reviewed by your team lead is <tt>document.c</tt>. Since Macrohard frowns on interns who rely on QAs to catch their mistakes you are encouraged to write your own testcases in <tt>document_test.c</tt>. Your mentor has left some notes in <tt>document.h</tt>. 

Since you're working with files, you should understand the basic notions of serialization and deserialization. Serialization is the process of converting the state of a data structure or object into a representation that can be stored (in this case, in a file) or transmitted. Deserialization is the reverse process, by which you can convert a serialized representation into the original data structure or object. These two processes are equal and opposite, and will cancel each other out if sequentially applied on something. That is, deserialize(serialize(x)) == x.


## Vector vs Document

Make sure you're completely clear on the difference between a vector and a document! Your document uses an **underlying** vector to represent the state of a file, and each entry in the vector corresponds to a single line in the file. This makes it much easier to manipulate individual lines. 

Remember how POSIX defines a line as 'A sequence of zero or more non- <newline> characters plus a terminating <newline> character' (http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html)? When you're working with the document, be careful how you handle newlines in the files you're opening. Remember, serialization and deserialization are equal and opposite. Your document already provides an abstraction for lines of text. Do you need to add the newline characters to the strings you store?

## Managing memory

Remember, man is man's best friend. Since you're working with dynamic memory, there are quite a few functions you should be familiar with before you proceed. malloc(), free(), realloc(),  calloc(), memmove()  are your friends, don't shy away!

* $ man 3 malloc
* $ man 3 free
* ...there's a pattern here

## Undefined Behavior

Undefined Behavior is simply a scenario or edge case for which there is no documentation describing how the code should react. For example try finding in the man pages what happens when you feed NULL in `strcmp()`. Your mentor will not answer questions like "What if my user wants an element past the end of the vector?", because that is undefined behavior. So for the entirety of this MP you should use `assert()` statements to check that your user is passing your function valid input before operating on the input. For example if you were implementing `strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2)` then your code should look like the following:

{% highlight c %}
#include <assert.h>
strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2) {
    assert(s1 != NULL && s2 != NULL);
    // Compare the two strings
    .
    .
    .
    return blah;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Writing test cases

Just to emphasize how important test cases are, this lab spec will repeat itself and remind you that as good programmers, you are expected to write your own test cases for document and vector.

## Compile and Run

To compile the release version of the code run:

{% highlight bash %}
make clean
make
{% endhighlight %}

To compile your code in debug mode, run `make debug` instead of `make`

To test vector:
{% highlight bash %}
./vector_test
{% endhighlight %}


or

{% highlight bash %}
./vector_test-debug
{% endhighlight %}



To test document:

{% highlight bash %}
./document_test
{% endhighlight %}


or

{% highlight bash %}
./document_test-debug
{% endhighlight %}


## Grading, Submission, and Other Details

Please fully read details on [Academic Honesty](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/#/overview#integrity). These are shared between all MPs in CS 241.

We will be using Subversion as our hand-in system this semester. Our grading system will checkout your most recent (pre-deadline) commit for grading. Therefore, to hand in your code, all you have to do is commit it to your Subversion repository.

To check out the provided code for `vector` from the class repository, go to your cs241 directory (the one you checked out for "know your tools") and run:

{% highlight bash %}
svn up
{% endhighlight %}


If you run `ls` you will now see a `vector` folder, where you can find this assignment! To commit your changes (send them to us) type:

{% highlight bash %}
svn ci -m "vector submission"
{% endhighlight %}

Your repository directory can be viewed from a web browser from the following URL: [https://subversion.ews.illinois.edu/svn/fa16-cs241/NETID/vector](https://subversion.ews.illinois.edu/svn/fa16-cs241/NETID/vector) where NETID is your University NetID. It is important to check that the files you expect to be graded are present and up to date in your svn copy.
