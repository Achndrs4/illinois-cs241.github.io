[ThreadSanitizer](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html) is a tool from Google, built into clang (and gcc), to help you detect race conditions in your code. For more information about the tool, see the [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/data-race-test/w/list) wiki (soon to be deleted) and the [Github wiki](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki).

## Using ThreadSanitizer

We have provided a new Makefile that will build your code with ThreadSanitizer. To build your code correctly, you will need the ThreadSanitizer runtime library, which you can install on the student VMs with this command:

```
sudo yum install libtsan
```

Note that running with tsan will slow your code down a bit.


## Example
```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int Global;

void *Thread1(void *x) {
    Global++;
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t t[2];
    pthread_create(&t[0], NULL, Thread1, NULL);
    Global = 100;
    pthread_join(t[0], NULL);
}
// compile with gcc -fsanitize=thread -pie -fPIC -ltsan -g simple_race.c
```
We can see that there is a race condition on the variable ```Global```. Both the main thread and the thread created with ```pthread_create``` will try to change the value at the same time. But, does ThreadSantizer catch it?

```
$ ./a.out

```
Yes! The ThreadSantizer report indicates that a thread T1 (created by the main thread on line 13) read from the address 0x7f73ed91c078 on line 7. TSan thinks this read is probably a data race, because it detected a write to the same address, by the main thread, on line 14, and there is no synchronization in the code. Suppose we add some locks:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int Global;
pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void *Thread1(void *x) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
    Global++;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t t[2];
    pthread_create(&t[0], NULL, Thread1, NULL);

    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
    Global = 100;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);

    pthread_join(t[0], NULL);
}
// compile with gcc -fsanitize=thread -pie -fPIC -ltsan -g simple_race.c
```

And run it:
```
$ ./a.out
$ 
```
TSan does not report any errors!
