## Introduction

In the past, you have been using `malloc()` to allocate memory on the heap. In this MP, you will be implementing your own version of `malloc()`. So by the end of this MP, you would theoretically be able to use your own malloc to compile and run any C code.

## Overview

You should implement your implementations of `malloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()` in `alloc.c`. We provide a version of `calloc()` that utilizes your implementation of `malloc()`. `alloc.c` will be the only file we test.

Don't modify `mreplace.c`, `mcontest.c`, `alloc-contest.c`, `debug.h`. Those files create the environment that replaces the standard libc malloc with your malloc. These files will be used for testing.

Your `malloc()` must allocate heap memory using `sbrk()`. You may not use files, pipes, system shared memory, `mmap()`, a chunk of pre-defined static memory, a chunk of pre-defined stack memory, other external memory libraries found on the Internet, or any of the various other external sources of memory that exist on a modern operating system.

## A Bad Example

Memory allocation seems like a mystery, but in actuality, we are making a wrapper around the system call `sbrk()`. Here's a really simple implementation of `malloc()`:

{% highlight c %}
void *malloc(size_t size) {
    return sbrk(size);
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, when we request `size` bytes of memory, we call `sbrk(size)` to increase the heap by `size` bytes. Then, we return a pointer to this memory, and we're done. Simple!

Here is our implementation of `free()`:

{% highlight c %}
void *free(void *ptr) {
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a "correct" way to implement `free()`. However, the obvious drawback with our implementation is that we can't reuse memory after we are done with it. Also, we have yet to implement `realloc()` and `calloc()`. Finally, we also have to check for errors when we call `sbrk()`.

Despite all of this, this is still a "working" implementation of `malloc()`. So the job of `malloc()` is not really to allocate memory, it is to keep track of the memory we've allocated so that we can reuse it. You will use methods that you've learned in class and practiced in the mini-valgrind lab to do this.

Your shell will support two optional arguments: `-h` and `-f`. Both options can potentially be used at once.

## Testing Your Code

In order to test your solution against the testers, run `./mcontest` with the tester you want. You MUST do this or your code will be run with the libc implementation!

Example:

{% highlight bash %}
./mcontest part1/tester-1
Memory failed to allocate!
[mcontest]: STATUS: FAILED=(256)
[mcontest]: MAX: 0
[mcontest]: AVG: 0.000000
[mcontest]: TIME: 0.000000
{% endhighlight %}

We've also distributed a bash script `run_all_mcontest.sh` to run all testers.

Here are what each of our error codes mean:

{% highlight bash %}
11: Seg Fault
15: Executed Too Long
139: Seg Fault
256, 512, 768, 1024: various errors in tester-# files
16640: Dynamic linking error
17408: Exceeded Memory Limit (2684354560)
{% endhighlight %}

## Contest

The malloc contest looks to pit your re-implementation of memory allocating functions against your fellow students. There are a few things to know:

* The test cases described above will be used for grading.
* The memory limit is 2.500GB.
* To submit your program into the contest, you simply commit to subversion. Your most recent SVN submission will be fetched somewhat frequently.
* We will assign a score to each of the three categories (max heap, average heap, and total time) based on how well your program performs memory management relative to a standard solution.
* You can pick a nickname in `NICKNAME.txt`. You will show up as this name on the contest webpage.
* On the webpage, each test will have either be green, which signifies that you passed the test, or red, which signifies that you failed the test. Clicking on the failed test will give you more details on the error output of the test.
* Your ranking will be determined by
.6 * max_memory + .2 * avg_memory + .2 * runtime

## Grading, Submission, and Other Details

Please fully read details on [Academic Honesty](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/#/overview#integrity). These are shared between all MPs in CS 241.

You will commit your code to the malloc folder in your subversion repository.

Here is the grading breakdown:

* 25% Part 1 (Tests 1-4)
* 25% Part 2 (Tests 1-8)
* 25% Part 2 (Tests 9-11)
* 25% Within 200% performance of libc
