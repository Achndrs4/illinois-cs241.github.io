## Honors
Couldn't get enough Systems Programming? Welcome to the Honors Section! In the CS 296 section 41 we go into in depth about operating systems. We will talk in depth about Security, Kernels, Parallel Programming and More!

This course is recommended for people who want to expand their systems knowledge with additional topics and a semester long group project of your choosing. You are given freedom to choose your project so long as it has a significant systems component in it.

You can also come to an assortment of mini-lectures at our regularly scheduled time. These will consist of advanced systems topics corresponding to what you are currently learning in 241.

## Syllabus

There will be several mini-lectures throughout the semester. These lectures will take place during the scheduled lecture time and will be announced ahead of time on Piazza. Slides will be posted below!

Every student is required to propose a project that must be approved by a TA. The project should be related to systems programming and it should clearly demonstrate and build upon concepts learned in regular [and/or honors] CS241 lectures.

Once every student has an approved project, you will be assigned a mentor who you will check-in with weekly for progress reports and code review.

At the end of the semester each student is expected to prepare a presentation of their project and give that presentation to their peers. It will include what you learned, challenges faced, results (if any), etc. The presentation will consist of a demonstration of your project along with a brief explanation of your project and results.

## Grading

{% highlight text %}
Project Proposal   : 5%
Final Presentation : 25%
Final Project      : 50%
Weekly Checkins    : 20%
Lecture Attendance : ??%
{% endhighlight %}

We do not have minimum thresholds and will be grading against other projects with a generous curve.

We will give you 3 lecture attendance drops, no questions asked you can miss three lectures.

## Proposals

Requirements:
* Projects may be done in teams of up to 3 people; if you want to work on a larger team, ask us first
* Project should be novel to you and your partners (we want you to explore new things)
* Project should take about 3 hours a week for each member of the team
* Must relate to systems programming in a meaningful way (ask us in advance if you aren't sure)
  
Your proposal should include the following:
* Overview (Alternatively, “Explain it to me like I am five”)
* Purpose (Why are you doing this? Why is it interesting?)
* Expected workload distribution among group members
* Projected project milestones (What will you do in the first month? Second month? etc.)
* Challenges you expect will arise in working on this project
 
## Presentations

More information to be posted soon.

## Project

The exact grading requirements of each project vary. You and your mentor will decide a reasonable scale at the beginning of the semester as a moving target.

## Weekly Checkins

You are required to meet with your mentor on a weekly basis. The meeting can last up to an hour and you will typically be going over what you did that week/what your goals are and any roadblocks you have encountered. To get full credit, you must show up and show the work that you have done.

We also add two requirements. For those of you starting your projects with research (ie figuring out what a filesystem is before implementing it) we want you to write about one paragraph for each checkin until you start writing code.

When you and your group start writing code, we expect you to use git and each group member commits his/her changes using their own account, this way the mentors can track how much each person is contributing to the project. That being said, a group project is a group effort meaning the group must coordinate who is doing what and what a fair load balance is between group members. Your mentor is here to guide you through roadblocks; check in on progress; and to answer any questions you have about the project.
